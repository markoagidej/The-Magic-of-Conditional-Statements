1. Decisions at the Crossroad
Task 1: Code Correction
You are provided with a Python script that uses conditional statements to tell if a number is positive, negative, or zero, but it has some errors. Identify and fix them.

Buggy Code:

number = input("Enter a number: ")

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
elif number = 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
else number < 0:
    print("The number is negative.")
    
2. The Greatest Showdown
Objective:
Harness the power of conditional statements to compare and determine values.

Task 1: Identify the Greatest
Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter three numbers. The program should then identify and print out the largest number among the three.

Task 2: Identify the Smallest
Extend your program from Task 1 to also determine the smallest number among the three and print it out.

Task 3: Equality Check
Enhance your program to handle cases where two or all of the numbers are equal. The program should display appropriate messages like "Two numbers are equal and the largest" or "All numbers are equal".

Expected Outcome: If we provide the numbers 3, 3, and 4, it should print out that "The smallest number is 3. The largest number is 4. There are two numbers equal to each other." Printing out which numbers are equal would be a great added bonus.

3. Leap Year Explorer
Objective:
Dive deep into the intricacies of the calendar by exploring the concept of leap years.

Task 1: Leap Year Checker
Write a Python program that prompts the user to input a year. The program should determine if the given year is a leap year or not and then display an appropriate message. Please note that this is the definition of a leap year: Every year that is exactly divisible by four is a leap year, except for years that are exactly divisible by 100, but these centurial years are leap years if they are exactly divisible by 400.

Expected Outcome: If you test the year 1900, is should be False. The year 2000 should be True. The year 2024 should be True
